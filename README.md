# bloom_life

Bloom Life is an app developed with Flutter framework.

The project goal is to show in the screen the temperature, light and humidity levels of a plant, based on previous species registers, the app could say if the plant is healthy. The data could be filtered by day, week or month. It is also possible to register new species and their needs and new plants.

This data was collected with an ESP32 card and sent to a NodeJS server, responsible for saving the data in the database and communicating with the application.
